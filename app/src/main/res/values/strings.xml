    <string name="boeing737_original">The Boeing 737 is a short- to  medium-range twin-jet narrow-body airliner developed and manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes in the United States. Originally developed as a shorter, lower-cost twin-engine airliner derived from the 707 and 727, the 737 has developed into a family of ten passenger models with capacities from 85 to 215 passengers. It was immediately realized that most airlines wanted a slightly higher passenger load, to which Boeing responded with the 737-200. Two sections were added to the fuselage.</string>
    <string name="boeing747">The Boeing 747 is an American wide-body commercial jet airliner and cargo aircraft, often referred to by its original nickname, Jumbo Jet. Its distinctive hump upper deck along the forward part of the aircraft has made it one of the most recognizable aircraft, and it was the first wide-body airplane produced. Manufactured by Boeing\'s Commercial Airplane unit in the United States, the 747 was originally envisioned to have 150 percent greater capacity than the Boeing 707, a common large commercial aircraft of the 1960s</string>
    <string name="boeing747_8">The Boeing 747-8 is a wide-body jet airliner developed by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It was officially announced in 2005. The 747-8 is the third generation of the 747, with a lengthened fuselage, redesigned wings, new engines, and improved efficiency. The 747-8 is the largest 747 version, the largest commercial aircraft built in the United States, and the longest passenger aircraft in the world.</string>
    <string name="boeing757">The Boeing 757 is a mid-size, narrow-body twin-engine jet airliner that was designed and built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is the manufacturer\'s largest single-aisle passenger aircraft and was produced from 1981 to 2004. The twin-jet has a two-crew member glass cockpit, turbofan engines of sufficient power to allow takeoffs from relatively short runways and higher altitudes, a conventional tail and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a super critical wing design.</string>
    <string name="boeing767">The Boeing 767 is a mid-to large-size, mid- to long-range, wide-body twin-engine jet airliner built by Boeing Commercial Airplanes.  It was Boeing\'s first wide-body twin-jet and its first airliner with a two-crew glass cockpit. The aircraft has two turbofan engines, a conventional tail, and, for reduced aerodynamic drag, a supercritical wing design. Designed as a smaller wide-body airliner than earlier aircraft such as the 747, the 767 has a seating capacity for 181 to 375 people, and a design range of 3,850 to 6,385 nautical miles (7,130 to 11,825 km), depending on variant.</string>
    <string name="boeing777">The Boeing 777 is a long-range wide-body twin-engine jet airliner developed and manufactured by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. It is the world\'s largest twinjet and has a typical seating capacity of 314 to 396 passengers, with a range of 5,240 to 8,555 nautical miles (9,704 to 15,844 km).</string>
    <string name="boeing777_x">The Boeing 777X is a new series of the long-range wide-body twin-engine Boeing 777 family that is under development by Boeing Commercial Airplanes.  The 777X is to feature GE9X new engines, new composite wings with folding wingtips, a denser cabin, and technologies from the Boeing 787.  The 777X series was launched in November 2013 with two variants: the 777-8 and the 777-9.</string>
    <string name="boeing787">Boeing 787 Dreamliner is an American long-haul, mid-size wide body, twin-engine jet airliner made by Boeing Commercial Airplanes. Its variants seat 242 to 335 passengers in typical three-class seating configurations.  It is the first airliner with an airframe constructed primarily of composite materials. The 787 was designed to be 20% more fuel-efficient than the Boeing 767, which it was intended to replace.</string>
